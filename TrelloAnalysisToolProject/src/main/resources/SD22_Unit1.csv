We discussed whether the methods should write to the screen or return a String. We landed on returning a String because maybe we want to use that String and put it on a website instead of just printing to the console.

Once we coded stubs for those methods, we made a new class with a different job. It had a Scanner (old-timey typewriter) and the W symbol in `main`. We then coded that to work, though we always got `null null` because our stubs didn't do anything. Then we fixed our stubs.

After getting a large number from `toCharArray()` I asked military people what time it was. They said 14:00. So if I wanted to impress them and said ""I'll see you at 27:00 hours"" what am I saying? How did you get that? Went around the clock twice to get the hours left... the remainder. What if I gave that clock 37 hands (or whatever amount we have in our array).

UML

* What is the purpose of UML? (Communicating class design to other people - maybe they speak Ruby. Also, documentation.)
* What are the three parts of the diagram?
* 4 visibilities, and their symbols if you can
* Diagram for a simple class (one private field, one method)
* Add class Other, how would you add this to diagram? Two ways. (show has-a arrow)
* Discuss HAS-A and how it works with owning class's field

JUnit

* What is the purpose of JUnit (writing code to test code). Answers like refactoring code to make sure it still works.
* (Someone will mention TDD.) What is the key to TDD? (A failing test first).
* What is it actually doing? (Writing methods to call methods in your class and assert if they output what you expected.)",SKIP (black),,,0,,0,0,0,0,2019-07-18T03:18:29.298Z,5ce72aac7c4264807d15fbf3,Day 10 - Friday 7/19,5ce72aac7c4264807d15fbe9,Unit1Schedule - SD22,false

If the user enters a non-number, an exception will be thrown, which students must handle. The user is notified of the invalid input, and prompted to continue entering input. All invalid entries are written to another list. 

If the user enters ""EXIT"", the system prints a goodbye message and exits.

However, if the user enters ""ADMIN"", they are presented with a chance to enter a password. If they enter the correct password ""PASSWORD"" they are presented with a menu to view each log of valid and invalid input.

If the user enters the wrong password, an `InvalidPasswordException` (custom exception class) is thrown, and the user is returned to the original numeric entry prompt.","Afternoon (lime), SKIP (black)",,,0,,0,0,0,0,2019-07-24T22:27:32.390Z,5ce72aac7c4264807d15fbf7,Day 14 - Thursday 7/25,5ce72aac7c4264807d15fbe9,Unit1Schedule - SD22,false
