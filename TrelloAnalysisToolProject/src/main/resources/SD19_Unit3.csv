- You intend to fly non-stop around the world, but can only go halfway around the world on a full tank. To aid your trip you can arrange many planes exactly like yours to assist with refueling. If a plane refuels you they are taking fuel out of their own reserve. All planes depart from the same airstrip and must land from where they took off. Assuming refueling can be done midair, ignoring refueling and turning time, and without crashing any plane, what is the minimum number of planes you will need?

- You have two ropes and a lighter. Each rope has the following property: If you light one end of the rope, it will take one hour to burn to the other end. They don't necessarily burn at a uniform rate. How can you measure a period of 45 minutes? The video below gives a hint and explains the solution.

- Find smallest difference
Given two arrays of integers, find the pair of values (one from each array) that has the smallest non negative difference.

- Check for primality
Given a number, write a method that would return a boolean value representing if the number is a prime.

- Write a Method in Java that takes two arrays of integers as parameters, and returns an array of integers. The two incoming arrays will be sorted. The array that you will return must contain all the values from both incoming arrays (including duplicates) and be in sorted order. Your solution must run in O(n) time, where n is the size of the array that you are returning.

- A group of four people is traveling on foot at night. They have only one flashlight to share. They come to a bridge that they must cross in order to get to their destination. The bridge is in disrepair, and will only support two people at a time. The flashlight must be used on the bridge in order to safely navigate the many missing planks. Each of the four people travels at a different speed. It takes each person a different amount of time to cross the bridge. The four people take 1 minute, 2 minutes, 7 minutes, and 10 minutes respectively to cross the bridge. How do you get everyone across the bridge in the least amount of time.

The next three questions should be worked on by the same ""interviewee"".

- Write a method in Java that takes in an array of integers and returns an integer. The incoming array will be consecutive integers starting at 0 with one integer missing: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (3 is missing). The integer that you will return is the integer that is missing. In this example, 3 should be returned. Your method must run faster than O(n) time where n is the size of the incoming array.

- Modify your method so that the incoming array does not need to start at 0. For example, input of [5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] should return 9. Your method must run faster than O(n) time where n is the size of the incoming array.

- Modify your method to allow for more than one missing number. Your method will return the first missing number. For example, input of [100, 101, 103, 104, 106, 107, 109, 110] should return the first missing number: 102. Your method must run faster than O(n) time where n is the size of the incoming array.

- Write a new (similar) method in Java that takes in an array of integers and returns an integer. The incoming array will be consecutive integers starting  anywhere ([10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24]. The incoming array will have some missing values (13, 21, and 23).

- Write some code (not necessarily a method) to print out the first 25 fibonacci numbers which are even. The fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. Your code should print out 0, 2, 8, 34, etc.

- Write a method that accepts an int and returns a string. The largest int that you can expect will be 9,999. The method should return the ""english"" version of the number passed in. For example, if 1,234 is passed in, the method should return ""one thousand two hundred thirty four"".

- Write a method called ""isLeapYear"" that takes an integer (year), and returns a boolean (if the year is a leap year.

- Write a method called ""factorial"" that takes an integer and returns the factorial of that number. For example, 6 factorial (written 6!) is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

- Write a bubble sort method that takes an array of integers and sorts them from smallest to largest. What is the time complexity? What are the Pro's an Con's of this implementation?

- Consider the fraction 16/64. Mathematically this is equivalent to 1/4. An odd, (and very incorrect) way of ""reducing"" 16/64 to 1/4 is to ""cancel"" the ""6"" on the top with the ""6"" on the bottom. Just ""remove"" them (because they are both ""6""). This leaves 1/4. Can you find another fraction with two digits on the top and two digits on the bottom where ""cancelling"" matching digits yields an equivalent fraction? This is hard. We're looking for a non-trivial solution.
