To aid your trip you can arrange many planes exactly like yours to assist with refueling. If a plane refuels you they are taking fuel out of their own reserve. All planes depart from the same airstrip and must land from where they took off. Assuming refueling can be done midair, ignoring refueling and turning time, and without crashing any plane, what is the minimum number of planes you will need?

-You have two ropes and a lighter. Each rope has the following property: If you light one end of the rope, it will take one hour to burn to the other end. They don't necessarily burn at a uniform rate. How can you measure a period of 45 minutes? The video below gives a hint and explains the solution.

-Find smallest difference
Given two arrays of integers, find the pair of values (one from each array) that has the smallest non negative difference.

-Check for primality
Given a number, write a method that would return a boolean value representing if the number is a prime.
